        WHAT TO DO:
            General info:
                We will create a program for the "ISRAEL TRAIN", that our customers can
                travel by train.

                Every customer will have:
                    1. name.
                    2. id.
                    3. ridesLeft (starts with zero).
                    4. inStation (starts with false).

                The customer can do:
                    1. recharge card - to get more rides ( in order to enter a station ).
                    2. enter a station (to travel) - if he is not already in a station,
                       and if he have rides left (subtract a ride).
                    3. leave a station (to go home) - if he is in a station.


                Please check if it is working without bugs.

              YOU CAN ADD MORE PRIVATE FIELDS OR METHODS IF YOU WANT.

              If you have any question, you can ask me by mail.

              GOOD LUCK,

              MAAYAN.
